This is a cloth simulation implemented in Unity using compute shaders.

Authors: Christian Tsalidis and Scott Naylor

We were inspired by[Sean Soraghan's code](https://github.com/SeanSoraghan/UnityMassSpringSystem) on this topic.

This repository also uses the "Make Geo" repository which can be found here https://github.com/kurtdekker/makegeo. This repo can create any primitive you need from code with correct UVs. It is highly recommended.
